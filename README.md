# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis
For our project, we are asked to help create a website to filter and search for UFO data by creating a HTML link through Javascript. We are asked to display all of the data we have collected on the UFO sightings and filter through various characterstics like date, city, country and more. We were able to make this happen for the project by working with JavaScript through VS Studio Code and both HTML and CSS attachments.  

## Results

First, we pull up the HTML UFO page and we see the filters and data along with a description of the site.

We search for the specific date and location we want at any point, and our search comes up after our filters have been placed

Our search works and we can see that we have found the specific UFO sighting we were searching for

## Summary
One thing that I would address for this webpage in order to better help with its filtered search is that when I was searching for the specific data in part 2, if you mispell or have an extra space in any of the filters you typed the dat will crash and not work. This would be a big help for people who are not able to be as percise and efficient on a computer to easily find the UFO data they are looking for. 

For the first recommnedation for further development would be to add lots of more raw data from UFO sightings in order to find older and perhaps more "real" cases. This would be important for researchers to have more valid information to reserach and study. Another recommendation would be to add more filters to the webpage. Maybe you could be able to search a specific area of the country like northwest or east coast, or a specific range of date periods.
